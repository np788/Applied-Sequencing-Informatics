# Applied-Sequencing-Informatics

This repo contains some files from the Applied Sequencing Informatics course at NYU Langone from spring 2021. The final-project folder contains files 
relevant to the final course project (obviously). The task was to integrate RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq data to identify likely targets for the 
FOXM1 transcription factor.

All relevant R scripts and BASH scripts are included in the /project subfolder. The parent folder contains the final report, presentation slides, and a PDF containing all the code used. The latter was requested by the instructors.
