# Applied-Sequencing-Informatics

This repo contains some files from the Applied Sequencing Informatics course at NYU Langone from spring 2021. The final-project folder contains files 
relevant to the final course project (obviously). The task was to integrate RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq data to identify likely targets for the 
FOXM1 transcription factor.
